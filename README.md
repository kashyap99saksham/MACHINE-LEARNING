Basic Ml Concepts

# :books: Important libraries in ML

-  `numpy`

> Library which contains mathamatical tools OR to include any types of mathamatics in our code

-  `pandas`

> help to import dataset and handle|manage the dataset

-  `matplotlib`

> helps to plot any chart and graphs

## :star: Data Preprocessing :

- cleaning of raw data which further go to algorithm for analysis.

#### Cleaning means:

- Missing Values

- Convert string to number (for easy Calculation)

  
  

# :books: Types of ML:

  

## :top: SuperVised Learning

  

- Make machine learn explicitly

- Output is given

- Data is already defined

- used for classification and linear regression


## :top: UnSuperVised Learning

- Machine Understands data(identifies data)

- does not predict

## :top: Reinforcement Learning

- Reward Based Learning

- maximize rewards
# :star: Types of REGRESSION MODELS:

- Simple linear reg.

- multiple linear reg.

- polynomial linear reg.

- support vector for reg.

- Decision tree reg

- random forest reg.

## Simple linear reg.

Y = Bo + B1*X 
|Y = dependent| X = independent  |
|--|--|
|Bo = constant,intercept  |B1 = slope |
## Multiple linear reg.
Y = Bo+B1*X1+B2*X2+B3*X3+....
## Polynomial Linear
Y =  Bo+B1*X1^1^+B2*X2^2^+B3*X3^3^+....
### :bird: Non Linear Regression
## Support Vector Regression
## Decision Tree Regression
Predict the values based upon tree
## Random Forest Regression
When a decision tree is divided into sub-trees then they makes forest of many trees.
