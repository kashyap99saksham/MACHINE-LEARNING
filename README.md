Basic Ml Concepts
# :boat: Two types of ML :
    SuperVised                 UnsuperVised
	  - Classification           - Clustering
	  - Regression				 - Association

# :books: Important libraries in ML

-  `numpy`

> Library which contains mathamatical tools OR to include any types of mathamatics in our code

-  `pandas`

> help to import dataset and handle|manage the dataset

-  `matplotlib`

> helps to plot any chart and graphs

## :star: Data Preprocessing :

- cleaning of raw data which further go to algorithm for analysis.

#### Cleaning means:

- Missing Values

- Convert string to number (for easy Calculation)

  
  

# :books: Types of ML:

  

## :top: SuperVised Learning

  

- Make machine learn explicitly

- Output is given

- Data is already defined

- used for classification and linear regression


## :top: UnSuperVised Learning

- Machine Understands data(identifies data)

- does not predict

## :top: Reinforcement Learning

- Reward Based Learning

- maximize rewards
# :star: Types of REGRESSION MODELS:

- Simple linear reg.

- multiple linear reg.

- polynomial linear reg.

- support vector for reg.

- Decision tree reg

- random forest reg.

## Simple linear reg.

Y = Bo + B1*X 
|Y = dependent| X = independent  |
|--|--|
|Bo = constant,intercept  |B1 = slope |
## Multiple linear reg.
Y = Bo+B1*X1+B2*X2+B3*X3+....
## Polynomial Linear
Y =  Bo+B1*X1^1^+B2*X2^2^+B3*X3^3^+....
### :bird: Non Linear Regression
## Support Vector Regression
## Decision Tree Regression
Predict the values based upon tree
## Random Forest Regression
When a decision tree is divided into sub-trees then they makes forest of many trees.	
# :shoe: Standard Deviation : 
	How Much an individual data is close to mean
	Its symbol is sigma (o-)
	Formula : square root of variance
# :cloud: Variance 
	To Calculate variance , take each difference,
	square it,then average the result
    
# :ring: Correlation
    There must be cause and effect relationship,
    simultaneous changes in two variables.
    
   *formulaa* :-
 **R^2^ = ((predicted_value - mean_value)^2^/(Y_value - mean_value)^2^)^2^**
 what/how is the role of independent variable on dependent variable

# * Classification *

# ⭐️ Types of Classification MODELS:

					  (Linear models)
 - Logistic Regression 
	
						(Linear models)
 - K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
 - Support Vector Machine
 - Kernal SVM
 - Naive Bayes
 - Decision Tree Classification
 - Random Forest Classification

## Logistic Regression
Ques.) What is difference between logistic regression and linear regression?

The essential  **difference between**  these two is that  **Logistic regression**  is used when the dependent variable is binary in nature. In contrast,  **Linear regression**  is used when the dependent variable is continuous and nature of the  **regression**  line is  **linear**.

==It use sigmoid function to make the curve for binary data==
